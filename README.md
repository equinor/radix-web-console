# Radix Web Console üèó

This is the web front-end for interacting with Radix. Most of the build
infrastructure is provided by
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so reading its
User Guide is recommended.

## Running, building

Good news: for development, you only need
[Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) and a
[code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)! To start the development
environment:

    docker-compose up

This builds a Docker image `radix-web-dev`, runs it in the container
`radix-web-dev_container`, mounts the local directory into `/app` in the
container, and runs the `npm start` script, which watches for changes and serves
the app on port 3000. The debugger also runs on port 9222.

Stop the server with Ctrl+C, but also run `docker-compose down` to
cleanup the Docker state.

**Important**: the `node_modules` directory is not mapped to the host. NPM
commands must be run in the container, even if you have NPM installed on the
host. To run a command in the container:

    docker exec -ti radix-web-dev_container <command>

For instance:

    docker exec -ti radix-web-dev_container npm install --save left-pad

To get a shell:

    docker exec -ti radix-web-dev_container sh

If you need to nuke `node_modules` you can stop the container and run:

    docker container rm radix-web-dev_container
    docker volume rm radix-web-dev_node-modules

If you change `package.json` (e.g. add a dependency), or want to force a clean
dev environment, you will need to rebuild the dev image:

    docker-compose up --build

## Folder structure

The base directory is organised as per Create React App. Within `/src`, however:

- `/init/`: Initialisation of the application (store, routing, etc)
- `/state/`: The application state ([documentation](./src/state/README.md))
- `/components/`: (Mostly) stateless UI components
  ([documentation](./src/components/README.md))
- `/api/`: üë©‚Äçüíª ‚è≥ coming soon‚Ä¶
- `/utils/`: Standalone utilities, organised by area of concern
- `/index.js`: Entry point for the app

## Writing and running tests

Tests are written in [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). Any file within
`src/` with the name `test.js` (or that ends with `.test.js`), is picked up by
the test runner.

Run the tests within the docker container:

    docker exec -ti radix-web-dev_container npm test

## Coding standards

Coding standards are enforced by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/). Please use an appropriate ESLint plugin for your
editor. To get ESLint to run properly you will need to have it set up in your
local environment (not the dev Docker container). You can do that by running:

    npm install --only=dev

## Production build

The production build is containerised in the project's `Dockerfile`. To run the
build image locally:

    docker build -t radix-web-prod .
    docker run --name radix-web-prod_container --rm -p 8080:80 radix-web-prod

The web server will be available on http://localhost:8080
