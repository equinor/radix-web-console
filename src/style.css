/**
 * We are using a variation of ITCSS. This file includes reusable styles, and
 * is assumed included by all components, even if being tested in isolation.
 * Treat this as a global dependency. Component-specific styling should be in
 * the CSS files of the component itself, as a local dependency.
 *
 * In order, files are categorised thus:
 *
 * - settings: global settings; variables only
 * - generic: resets; applies to most of the DOM
 * - elements: bare HTML elements
 * - objects: OOCSS-style reusable concepts: layouts, mini-layouts, animations
 * - overrides: utility-based styles and browser overrides
 *
 * Note that the biggest section of ITCSS, "components", is not defined here.
 * Components are defined in React and styled in their own directory. Also
 * missing is "tools" (in ITCSS these are basically mixins, which we don't use
 * since we don't use a preprocessor). Finally, "trumps" has been renamed
 * "overrides", since it would otherwise hurt to see that name.
